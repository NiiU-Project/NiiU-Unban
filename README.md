## NiiU Unban
NiiU Unban is a Homebrew Tool to Unban your Nintendo Wii U. Sorry, 102-2812 cannot be unbanned yet. This is kind of early beta so I'd say please do not actually test it. If you are on RedNAND it should be okay.
/!\ IF YOU BRICK YOUR WII U, AGAIN IT'S AT YOUR OWN RISK! WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FROM WHAT YOU DO WITH THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED! /!\

## Who made this?
RGeeK and DaKux made this. RGeeK made the code, used some Homebrew Libs and DaKux did the icons and XML.
